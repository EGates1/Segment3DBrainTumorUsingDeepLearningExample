## Skull Stripping
===============

**Neurofeedback Skull-stripped (NFBS) repository**

/rsrch1/ip/egates1/NFBS\ Skull\ Strip/NFBSFilepaths.csv. File paths are absolute for the time being.

Data downloaded from http://preprocessed-connectomes-project.org/NFB_skullstripped and consists of 125 high-resolution T1w images (de-faced) with ground truth brain masks.

## Tumor Segmentation
===============

**MICCAI 2018 Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge**

/rsrch1/ip/egates1/MICCAI_BraTS_2018_Data_Training/BraTS18_filepaths_train_val_tst.csv.
The paths are relative to the MICCAI_BraTS_2018_Data_Training directory

Training data contains 210 high grade glioma (HGG cases) and 75 low-grade glioma (LGG) cases. 163 of the HGG cases also have overall survival in days.
 
Each case has T1, T2, FLAIR, T1CE, and seg (for training data) as provided by the challenge organizers https://www.med.upenn.edu/sbia/brats2018.html. Labels are: enhancing tumor (4), peritumoral edema (2), and the necrosis/non-enhancing tumor (1). Input images have been rigidly co-registered, skull stripped, and resampled to 1mm isotropic resolution.

A few auxiliary files have been added for each case: mask (all non-zero pixels), tumor (union of ground truth segmentation labels), and nontumor (brain â€“ tumor).
