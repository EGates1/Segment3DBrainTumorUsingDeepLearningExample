%% 3-D Brain Extraction from MRI
%    Train and cross validate a 3-D U-net for brain extraction on T1 image
%% load nifti data 
%   manu -
%          load nifti data from /rsrch1/ip/egates1/NFBS\ Skull\ Strip/NFBSFilepaths.csv 
%          into matlab data structure

%% setup data for k-fold cross validation
%   aurian - split the data into training/ validation/  test  sets


%% load the 3D U-net structure
%   priya - insert code for the 3D Unet

%% train the model on the training set for each fold in the k-fold

%% evaluate the average dice similarity
%   manu - output nifti files of the test set predictions
%   priya - visualize differences in itksnap

%% compare to MONSTR
%   @egates1 - do you have MONSTR predictions on this dataset ? are there any papers that have already done this ?
